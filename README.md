I was talked into making a photo booth based on a Make magazine article <https://makezine.com/projects/raspberry-pi-photo-booth/>

Some of the items I'm starting with:
- Raspberry Pi 5
- Raspberry Pi Zero W
- Raspberry Pi Pico W
- HP sprocket studio pro
- Asus ZenScreen Touch MB16AMT
- a Bluetooth remote shutter button
- several different Logitech webcams, ranging from the C320 to the Brio.
